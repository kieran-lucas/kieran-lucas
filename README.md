## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I love creating games and exploring the intersection of **game development and AI**.  
Currently learning and improving skills in **C++, Python, C#, Unity**, and version control tools like **Git & GitHub**.  

My vision is to **integrate AI into products**, build intelligent systems, and develop innovative AI-driven games and applications.  

I enjoy solving challenging problems, experimenting with new technologies, and constantly learning to grow as a developer.
